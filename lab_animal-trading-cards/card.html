			<p id="summary">The clever Sciuridae family (highly varied with 285 species, like the <a href="https://goo.gl/4NbAJR">flying squirrel</a>) were purposely introduced to US city parks to create <a href="https://www.popsci.com/blog-network/ladybits/squirrels-and-men-how-we-moved-squirrels-our-cities">“a bucolic atmosphere”</a>. To prevent wear from gnawing on nuts, their front four teeth continue to grow throughout their lifetime. When threatened, squirrels run away in a zigzag pattern (a strategy to escape predators), but it also leads to discombobulated drivers!</p>
